Introduction to Dash

As a Data Scientist, you make graphs and Visualisations all the time. Mostly for exploratory analysis and communicating your results. Often, these graphs are static, and end up as an image in a report or slide deck. But imagine the expressive power of your graphs as they become interactive and are served to your clients at any time! Dash does just that. It is a framework, to be used with Python, to serve Plotly graphs (and other content) as a reactive web app. In this talk I will tell you everything you need to know to get started with Dash. We will get started with the setup and the basics. Next, we will build our own app and add some basic interaction. Also, you will see how you can incorporate all kinds of complicated analysis techniques and predictive models. Lastly, I will show you how to do some hacking to bring even more advanced features to your app.

Dash at Alliander

Alliander is an energy network company maintaining the electricity and gas network. We are in the middle of the energy transition which has much influence on the electricity network. To find the best solution to make the network ready for more solar energy and electric vehicles Alliander is experimenting with energy storage. Sponsored by the European Union there is the CityZen program with, amongst others, a Virtual Power Plant project. About 40 households in Amsterdam Nieuw-West have a battery installed in their home. During the day solar energy is stored in the battery and this energy can be used at moments where it is needed and the sun doesn't shine.

As a Data Scientist I analyze the data gathered from the batteries. I created algorithms to steer the batteries and run experiments and I make calculations on the electricity grid since we would like to know the use and influence of the batteries on the load, voltage and current. Plotly Dash is a great way to visualize the results of these experiments and make them understandable for end users. In this talk I will show all the nice things Maarten told about applied to a real project.
