* **Squash**: I started playing squash couple years ago and straight away loved the game. It's a fast one and it really gives quite an adrenaline rush.

* **Drone**: I find it a closest thing to be actually flying, especially with a VR googles. I've been taking drone with me to most of my trips and getting to the places you normally cannot go yourself.

* **Lonely planet**: I am always planning my next trip. I've been to many wonderful places, but the list of places still to visit keeps on ever growing. As well as the list of places where I want to go back ðŸ˜‰

* **Boomerang**: I am always trying to bring back something that reminds me of the place I visited, this one is from Sydney.

* **The wither books**: Better than the game, especially the Wither Saga is a fantastic journey.

* **Headphones**: I love listening to music and I love coding with music. I try to go out for (rock) concerts as often as possible.

* **Red and yellow cards**: In my part time I am a referee for kids football competitions.
