* **Books representing what I read mos**t: fantasy, (popularised) science, and books about cooking
* **Nightwish album**: symphonic metal has been my go-to since secondary school (Floor's a beast!)
* **Dataworkz laptop**: distro hopping between flavours of Linux to avoid Microsoft / Apple / Google
* **Affie's collar:** she's the sweetest little puppy when she isn't keeping me up at night
* **Raspberry Pi**: started my homelab with this, spent more than I care to admit at this point
* **Chess pieces**: most will probably beat me, but I still enjoy a good game
* **Dice:** in our home, Friday night is Dungeons and Dragons night
* **3d printed miniature**: printed this on my resin printer for one of my girlfriend's games
