* **Square academic cap**: Part of the sub-fusc of Oxford; I completed a PhD (Oxford / TU Delft) in cybersecurity and statistics.
* **Chopin**: I'll try to play piano every day.
* **Headphones**: A great tool for easily distracted persons who need to do some coding.
* **Singing Bowl**: Being an ASMR aficionado these sounds help me to relax.
* **Horse guards**: I lived in the UK for some time during my graduate training.
* **Calculator:** The tool I used when the computational aspect of statistical modeling did not yet require a cluster computer.
* **Geo triangle**: In statistics, you only know what you measure.
* **Chess board and pieces**: I started playing in December 2015 and try to play a game or two every day ([https://www.chess.com/member/mproeling](https://www.chess.com/member/mproeling "https://www.chess.com/member/mproeling")).
* **Binoculars**: Having worked in statistics and machine learning for some years now, I specialized in finding hidden patterns and looking for a needle in a (usually imbalanced) haystack.
* **Lego**: Guess this is typical and needs no explanation.
* **Snorkel**: Although my experience is limited to only a few dives I really like diving.
