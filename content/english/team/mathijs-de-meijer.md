* **Life motto**: Live life as if it were production code :).
* **Phone**: My phone is my mobile window onto the world, with an extra 7500mAh battery casing and another battery pack I love the practically infinitesupply of wonder in the form of podcasts, audiobooks and video's.
* **Laptop**: My laptop is way to powerful and together with my trusty backup storage, works as my personal cloud provider.
* **Headphones**: My noise canceling headphones increase reality's signal/noise ratio whenever required.
