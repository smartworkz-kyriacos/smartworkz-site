* **Shoes**: If you give someone a good shoe to walk, he will learn how to run!
* **Raspberrypi**: first time I fell in love with IT.
* **Penknife**: Most useful tool to have in your pocket (much more then a phone), specially when I go hiking.
* **Dices**: I really enjoy playing boardgames, specially if it is in good company.
* **Wedding ring**: My wife made me do it.
* **Bottle opener**: Qui bene bibit, bene dormit; qui bene dormit non peccat; qui non peccat vadit in caelum. Ergo, qui bene bibit vadit in caelum.
* **Pizza cutter**: I'm always open for good food, specially if it is Italian!
* **Cross**: Stands for what I believe.
