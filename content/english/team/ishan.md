* Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 (HHKB): 60% mechanical keyboard, Blanc Keycaps, 45g Topre switches, Caps lock mapped to Ctrl-key for Vim (also why I type with caps lock on a lot when we pair program on your machine). Fits in my laptop bag easily
* iPad Pro: portable 2nd screen (is where my terminal lives), else notetaking machine
* Apple Pencil: I like taking handwritten notes, only readable by myself
* Roost Stand: brings the laptop screen up to eyelevel. Compact design takes almost no space in my bag


* iPhone 11 Pro: dedicated Spotify playing device, sometimes the music stops because it can apparently also make calls.
* Apple Watch: mostly for setting timers to keep me focused and tracking exercises.
* Apple Trackpad: Switching between left-hand and right-hand mousing
* Razer Viper Ultimate: for pointing at stuff more accurately (also used for gaming)
* PowerBeats Pro: Bluetooth headphones that do not fall out of my ears (while shaking my head looking at my old code)


* Insta360 One X: to create 360 pictures and videos
* Oculus Quest 2: playing VR games, replaying 360 videos I create
* Shoei helmet: I like to ride a motorcycle every now and then
* Kindle Voyage: for reading books without any distractions
* Book – Designing Data-intensive Applications: great overview of the technologies I’m using in my daily work.
